Before we based on existing invoices.

    desc:     "mon-avocat.fr is <a href=\"https://www.mon-avocat.fr/\" tagert=\"_blank\" style=\"color:inherit;\"><u>an online search engine to find lawyers</u></a> close by either according to the domain involved by visitor's search.<br/><br/><u>Framework migration:</u><br/>When I started to work at mon-avocat.fr, I was the only developper and the website was managed by a freelance developper with Zend Framework 1. Due to LTS ending 28/09/2016 and that I wasn't familiar with this framework. I choosed to switch to Laravel and to make a stronger code base. In 3 month we switched the search engine (which was the online services we got at this time), made a new administration UI and made a new graphic UI for our frontend. Since that we using Laravel 5.*<br/><br/><u>Scoring managment;</u><br/>Scoring is, basically, in which order we should list lawyers when some visitors hit the search button. We made a lot of work on that subject. At start there was no custom ordering, only alphabetic order was used and was clearly in favor of lawyer that have a name starting wiith first alphabet letters.<br/>Today, we're handling scoring with a much smother way. We divided scoring in two parts: static which estimate the number of leads a lawyer got and dynamic which mostly depends on visitor position when he hits the search button.<br/><br/><u>Search engine overhaul:</u><br/>With more and more hits, we had to focus onto our core service: the search engine. At first he was based on a simple but efficient SQL query. For sure, with traffic increase, this was'nt fast enought and started to be slow due to multiple concurrent hits. So we started looking into the famous ElasticSearch to index all our lawyers, their position, score and all other needed informations in lawyers listing. With ES implementation, we reduced search engine time by 3.<br/><br/><u>GraphQL API:</u><br/>After the first graphic overhaul we stated that we needed to get a new branding and so a real analysis of our frontend. So we started rethink our frontend by focusing on emergent technologies like VueJS. Since VueJS is Javascript-based, we used facebook's GraphQL logic to make an API to connect backend & frontend. GraphQL permit us to make simple queries to get everything frontend needs in a short time. But we choosed to implement it through PHP and not usual node.js implementation. So we got some of the features that made GraphQL (such as subscription), not available."
